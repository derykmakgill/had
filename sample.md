# Title

Hi! 👋 I’m from Portugal 🇵🇹 and I’m now doing my Master’s degree 🎓 in Computer Science and Engineering at TU/e, in Eindhoven. At the same time, I’m working at Protocol Labs on the decentralization of the web 🌐. I believe in the transparency and openness of the world, in an united Europe 🇪🇺 and that we should all have equal rights 🏳️‍🌈.
