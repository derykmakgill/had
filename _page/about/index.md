# About Deryk Makgill

I'm an armchair researcher, writer, and digital archeologist who also builds businesses and invests. In the past, I've worked in private intelligence and I've been marketing director, web and graphic designer, salesman, software consultant, campaign manager, and operations director for some startups and companies. I went to the University of Michigan for two semesters where I studied Latin and Ancient Greek before I dropped out.

## Past Employment & Some Contracts

My employee days are over but here are some of the companies and organisations I've worked for or with. It should go without saying that they're not in any way accountable for anything I've done in the past or anything I will do in the future.

## Monthly Donations

Here are some organisations and projects to which I send a small amount of money every month. I don't generally believe in the donor-funded model, but I think they're doing important work.
